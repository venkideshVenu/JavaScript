Module 1 
JavaScript Notes

- every browser is empowered by JavaScript
- initially created to make pages alive
- javascript codes are called scripts.

- JavaScript is a high level multi-paradigm object-oriented Programming Language
- it is also Synchronous* and single threaded in Behaivior
- it is the language of Web and used to make web pagers and web applications work dynamically.


* Synchronous : every code is excecuted line by line


Node.js 

Node.js is an open source, cross platform, back end javascript runtime enviroment that runs on the V8 engine and excecute JavaScript 
code outside a web browser which was designed to build scalable network applications.


- for developing server side and networking applications


Module 2 : basics of JavaScript

                 Variables in JS

- they are containers for storing data
- Variable means anything that can vary


var keyword

- reserved keyword in JavaScript which is used to declare Variables
- can store data of any data-type


Statically Typed language : each variable and expression is already known at compile time
Synamically Typed Language : variables can receive different values at runtime and their type is defined at run time


Rules

* all javascript variables must be identified with unique names called identifies

- names can contain letters digits, unserscores, and dollar signs
- names must begin with a letter
- names can also begin with $ or _
- names are case sensitive
- reserved words cannot be used as variable names
- variable names cannot contain spaces
- variable names cannot contain special characters




Arrays in JavaScript

- in JavaScript arrays can store values of different data types whereas in statically types language arrays will store only that data by which the array is defined

- it enable storing multiple calues under a same varialble name and we can perform operations on them by using different methods

- array starts with index 0

var arr = ['array','elements','...']



Array methods
- push() : adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length
- pop() : removes the last element from an array and returns that element
- shift() : removes the first element from an array and returns that element
- unshift() : adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new



objects

object is an unordered collection of key value pairs. each key-value pair is called a property.

the key of a property can be string. and the value of a propery can be any value. eg: string, number, attay and even a function.

JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object. most commonly used one is to use the object literal notation



object methods
- hasOwnProperty() : returns true if the object has the specified property as its own property
