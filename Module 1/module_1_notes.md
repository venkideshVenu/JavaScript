## 📘 Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript

### 🌐 What is JavaScript?

- Every modern browser is powered by JavaScript.
- Originally created to make web pages interactive and "alive."
- JavaScript code is commonly referred to as **scripts**.
- JavaScript is a **high-level**, **multi-paradigm**, **object-oriented** programming language.
- It is **synchronous** and **single-threaded** by default.
- JavaScript is known as the **language of the web** and is used to build **dynamic web pages and applications**.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Synchronous:** JavaScript executes code **line-by-line**, in the order it appears. This behavior ensures predictability but can be limiting for time-consuming tasks.
  > Example:  
  > ```js
  > console.log("First");
  > console.log("Second");
  > console.log("Third");
  > // Output: First → Second → Third
  > ```

- JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms:
  - Functional programming
  - Object-oriented programming
  - Event-driven programming

## 🖥️ Node.js

### 🔧 What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is an **open-source**, **cross-platform**, **JavaScript runtime environment**.
- Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**.
- Allows execution of JavaScript **outside the browser**, primarily on the **server-side**.
- Designed to build **scalable network applications**.

### 🔍 Features of Node.js

- Used for developing **server-side** and **networking applications**.
- Enables JavaScript to handle backend development, APIs, file systems, databases, etc.
- Follows **non-blocking** and **event-driven architecture**, making it ideal for I/O-heavy operations.

### ⚙️ Real-World Applications

- Web servers
- RESTful APIs
- Real-time apps (like chat apps)
- Streaming services
